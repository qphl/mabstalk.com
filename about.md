Ben obtained his Pharmacy Degree with Starred First Class Honours from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, before registering as a Pharmacist with the General Pharmaceutical Council in 2009. He went on to gain a PhD in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Bath in 2013 under the supervision of Dr Ian Eggleston, which was followed by a nine-month Postdoctoral Research Position at the University. Ben worked at St Georgeâ€™s Hospital in London as an Aseptic Services Pharmacist before returning to the South West to join the R&D team at Bath ASU in October 2014.

## Dr Terry Chapman MPharmacol

Terry gained his Master of Pharmacology degree from the University of Bath in 2014. During his degree, he took on an 18-month placement within the research team of Bath ASU. Through his placement, he learnt about stability assessment of small molecules and biological pharmaceuticals. He is now undertaking a PhD investigating antibody-drug conjugates, specifically regarding characterisation, stability and safety.

## Dr Richard Parry

Richard is a postdoctoral scientist with a particular interest in drugs that interact with the immune system. During his PhD, he studied T-lymphocyte co-stimulation with Professor Stephen Ward, which sparked his interest in immunopharmacology. He carried out postdoctoral research on therapeutic ex-vivo manipulation of T lymphocyte function with Professor Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania.

He currently works in the Bath ASU Research and Development laboratory determining the stability of immunotherapeutic proteins. He has over ten years of experience in academic and commercial laboratories and has authored over twenty original research and review articles.

## Francesca Mason

Francesca obtained her degree in Chemistry with Pharmaceutical and Forensic Science from the University of Bradford. Following this she worked as a Medical Laboratory Technician at Homerton Hospital in London, supporting the Biomedical Scientists. She then moved to the South West in 2011 and worked as a Research Scientist at a pharmaceutical company called Chiesi. She remained there for over five years, researching novel formulations and device design for inhalation products. She joined the R&D team at Bath ASU in October 2017 as a PhD student, investigating the physicochemical stability of multi-drug combinations in palliate care.

## Josh Carter
