This post is not specifically about the stability of BmAb eye syringes.

However, given the attempts by Novartis to stop the use of BmAb as an unlicensed alternative to their Ranibizumab (Lucentis), we thought it interesting at least that Roche have added some warnings to their Bevacizumab SPC in relation to its unlicensed intravitreal use.

We compared the added sections of the BmAb SPC to the Lucentis SPC. Every single new warning that appears in the BmAb SPC also appears in the Lucentis SPC along with many others. We are sure many of you have already done this and come to your conclusions about its relevance.

We have highlighted the similarities below;

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">Red</span>** = Special warnings and precautions  
**<span style="color: #ff9900;">Amber</span>** = Adverse reactions  
**<span style="color: #3366ff;">Blue</span>** = Product class related adverse reaction

The text below is the new section of the Bevacizumab SPC.

_Intravitreal use_

Avastin is not formulated for intravitreal use.

_Eye disorders_

Individual cases and clusters of serious ocular adverse reactions have been reported following unapproved intravitreal use of Avastin compounded from vials approved for intravenous administration in cancer patients. These reactions included **<span style="color: #ff0000;">infectious endophthalmitis</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">intraocular inflammation</span>** such as sterile endophthalmitis, **<span style="color: #ff9900;">uveitis</span>** and **<span style="color: #ff9900;">vitritis</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">retinal detachment</span>**, **<span style="color: #ff0000;">retinal pigment epithelial tear</span>**, <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>intraocular pressure increased</strong></span>, intraocular haemorrhage such as **<span style="color: #ff9900;">vitreous haemorrhage</span>** or <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>retinal haemorrhage</strong></span> and **<span style="color: #ff9900;">conjunctival haemorrhage</span>**. Some of these reactions have resulted in various degrees of visual loss, including permanent blindness.

_Systemic effects following intravitreal use_

A reduction of circulating VEGF concentration has been demonstrated following intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Systemic adverse reactions including **<span style="color: #3366ff;">non-ocular haemorrhages</span>** and **<span style="color: #3366ff;">arterial thromboembolic</span>** reactions have been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors, and there is a theoretical risk that these may relate to VEGF inhibition.
