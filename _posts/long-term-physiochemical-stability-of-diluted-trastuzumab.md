The study being considered does not conduct sampling at required times for a 6 month study (5.6) and only data for two sampling points is provided (T = 0 and 180). The study does not contain sufficient numbers of independent batches or independent replicates (5.7) to meet acceptance criteria. Minimum required testing protocols (6) a), b) and f) were not performed.

## Study Methods Summary

The study did not evaluate visual characteristics (7.2) or changes in pH (7.3). Quantification of sub-visible particle numbers was not performed (7.4). Section 7.5 suggests a range of techniques to comprehensively assess the physical state of the protein. As such, not all listed techniques need to be performed, however the range of techniques employed do need to satisfy criteria for a comprehensive evaluation. The combination of techniques employed in this study can be considered to meet the criteria for a comprehensive evaluation of physical stability. For section 7.6 (which should also be considered in combination with some techniques performed as part of 7.5) the combination of techniques employed would not provide a comprehensive evaluation of chemical stability. By way of example, techniques employed would not detect minor changes in deglycosylation or glycation by small neutral sugars. No assessment of biological activity (7.7) is attempted. This is significant as changes in glycan profile (not determined in 7.6) are known to have impact upon biological activity.
